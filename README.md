# JS-RockPaperScissors
This is my JS repo for Rock Paper Scissors game

index.html is the HTML backbone.

In main.js, I defined functions used to operate the game:
- Prompting human to enter options
- Having computer choose
- Comparing options and registering, comparing scores
- Announcing the winner
- Limiting 5 rounds.

In main2.js, these updates were made:
- an UI with field to enter options
- Integrating functions from main2.js to operate as the button is clicked

In main3.js, you would find these updates:
1. the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt.
2. Add a div for displaying results
3. change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
4. Display the running score, announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points.
